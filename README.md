# 📖 Project Name

## Wikipedia Blocking Policies

### About this project <a name="about-project"></a>

This study investigates the relationship between editors’ disruptive behavior and regulation policies on English Wikipedia, focusing on the Blocking Policy page1. The study collects and analyzes data from 2004 to 2022 using the Wikipedia API, page statistics, and keyword extraction2. The study tests two hypotheses:

- Evolving policies do not reduce editor blocks and reblocks, and 
- Biased treatment and vague punishment policies lead to more disruptive behavior.

The study finds evidence to support both hypotheses and discusses the implications for online governance and policymaking. The study also examines the diversity of language preferences and perspectives among editors and administrators, and suggests future directions for research.

**Detailed report on this project is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xK5NjvH3bmb-nX4b5aHY3u800HZNGac5_eHZ0wO_3-k/edit?usp=sharing).**

## 🛠 Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

- `Python3`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn`

<!-- Features -->

- This project demonstrates an overall evolution in the community standard of Wikipedia.
- Authors of this project have done both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data to prove or disprove their two hypotheses.
- The project is open access and free to use for everyone.
- The collected data is also stored in a google drive of the authors which can be downloaded by any user.
- This project includes all codes including collection of data, cleaning of data, and visualization of data.
- The notebook also includes the primary analysis by the authors.
- The project report is linked in the [project description](#about-project).
- A [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file is added in the repository which can be used by a user to directly install all necessary `Python3` packages for this project.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started
To clone the repository in local environment try following steps.

### Prerequisites

- [x] A web browser like Google Chrome.
- [x] A code editor like Visual Studio Code with Git.

You can check if Git is installed by running the following command in the terminal.
```
$ git --version
```

Likewise for `python` and `pip` for package installation.
```
$ python --version

```
### Setup

Clone the repository using [this link](https://github.com/PrangonGhose/wikipedia-blocking-policies.git).

### Install

In the terminal, go to your file directory and run this command.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/PrangonGhose/wikipedia-blocking-policies.git
```
### Get into development

In the terminal, run these commands to get into development.
```
$ cd wikipedia-blocking-policies

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

```

The required data folder can be manually downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1WHFJ6wm4ElKH4KIAsa3A1ph4Bt34VYsH) and be unzipped manually by the user.

Or it can also be done automatically later while continuing with the project notebook.

Now you can open the [wikipedia notebook](wikipedia.ipynb) and continue with the project.

<!-- Future Features (optional) -->

## 🔭 Future Features <a name="future features"></a>

- Utilizing editors' IP addresses sourced from Wikipedia's API can enhance research insights by identifying prevalent violation locations.
- Acquiring gender data of administrators can facilitate exploration of gender diversity and potential biases within the administrative landscape.
- Further investigation into correlations between edit frequency, language preferences, and information disparities across Wikipedia pages in various languages is warranted to deepen understanding of these complex dynamics.
